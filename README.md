Install SoundID Reference via Homebrew

This recipe is designed to install the latest SoundID Reference
(rebranded from former "Sonarworks Reference 4") via the MacOS installer.
Note that Homebrew project will reject Casks or Formulae that have volatile
download links
(see [homebrew-cask#57634](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/57634)).
Currently this Cask appears to suffer from that issue.  For now, I will try to
maintain this here in incubation phase because it is useful to me and might be
for others. :smile:

## Installation

First, make sure you have installed [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) and
[`homebrew-cask`](http://caskroom.io/) if you haven't yet.

Then, run the following in your command-line:

    brew tap lyraphase/homebrew-soundid-reference

## Usage

**Note**: For info run:

    brew info --cask soundid-reference

Once the tap is installed, you can install `soundid-reference`!

    brew install --cask soundid-reference

To uninstall run:

    brew uninstall --cask soundid-reference

## Development

useful targets.

This will install a symbolic link to this git repo under:i

file location.
